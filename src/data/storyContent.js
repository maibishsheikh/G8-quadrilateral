    title: "A Strange Sighting",
    text: "Hui Min and Sanjay arrive at the Savanna Ranger Academy as dawn breaks over the plains. Through their binoculars, strange four-sided geometric creatures roam the grasslands. 'Look over there!' Hui Min points excitedly. 'That enclosure sign says RECTANGLE, but from here it looks like a skewed fence!' Sanjay grabs his ranger toolkit. 'At the academy, we never identify a species just by squinting from the jeep. We need to check its sides, angles, and diagonals before writing any field-guide entry!'",
    highlight: "Never classify a species by appearance — inspect its features!",

    title: "Check the Features",
    text: "Gigi the Giraffe, the academy's senior lookout, strides over to the field-guide desk with a specimen sketch. 'Rangers,' Gigi warns, 'looks deceive. Behold this creature with four equal sides stretched out very thin! Hui Min thought it was just a diamond diamond-kite. But test its diagonals: they cross at exactly 90 degrees and bisect each other!' Sanjay checks his notes: 'Four equal sides and perpendicular bisecting diagonals — that is a true Rhombus!'",
    highlight: "Three vital feature groups: Sides (equal & parallel), Angles (equal & supplementary), Diagonals (bisect, equal, 90°).",

    title: "The Family Tree",
    text: "Gigi points her neck toward the grand Savanna Lineage Board. 'Quadrilateral species belong to a living family tree. Just as a golden retriever is still a dog, every square is still a rectangle and a rhombus!' Hui Min gasps. 'A square inherits opposite sides parallel from the parallelogram branch, four right angles from the rectangle branch, and four equal sides with perpendicular diagonals from the rhombus branch! Always name its most specific species!'",
    highlight: "The inclusion hierarchy: a square earns every title, but its most specific name is Square!",
    character: "Gigi & Hui Min",

    panel: 3,
    title: "Filed in the Field Guide",
    text: "At the observation post, a creature rests against the riverbank. Sanjay measures: opposite sides are parallel, angle A is 68 degrees. 'By co-interior angles between parallel lines, angle B must be 180 minus 68, which is 112 degrees!' Hui Min records: 'Confirmed: Parallelogram, with reasoned angle derivation.' Gigi stamps the certificate with the Academy Seal: APPROVED. 'Ready for the field, Rangers — let the QuadQuest begin!'",
    highlight: "Always provide a geometric reason: every angle and side follows rigorous proof!",
